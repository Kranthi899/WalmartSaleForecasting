Walmart Sales Forecasting

Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from 45 Walmart stores and predicts weekly sales. The goal is to understand sales trends, identify the impact of holidays, and build predictive models for better forecasting.

Business Objective
Predict store sales for a given week
Analyze the impact of major holidays (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Super Bowl, Labor Day) on sales
Identify patterns based on time and store locations

Dataset
Source:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/walmart-sales-forecast

Key Features:
Store: Unique store number
Date: Week of sales
Weekly_Sales: Total sales for that week
Holiday_Flag: Indicates if the week had a major holiday

Steps in the Project
Data Exploration: Understand the dataset and clean it
EDA: Visualize sales trends and holiday impacts
Feature Engineering: Extract time-based features
Modeling: Build models to predict weekly sales
Evaluation: Measure model performance

How to Run

1)Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Walmart-Sales-Forecasting.git
cd Walmart-Sales-Forecasting

2)Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3)Run the analysis
jupyter notebook

4)Key Findings
Sales spike during major holidays, especially Christmas and Thanksgiving
Store 20 consistently performs the best
Time-based factors like month and week influence sales trends

5)Future Improvements
